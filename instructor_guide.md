# Instructor's guide to running a 'Boost your research reproducibility with binder' workshop

## Target audience
This workshop is aimed at researchers and others who are:
* Interested in reproducibility, containers, Docker or continuous integration;
* Already familiar with R Markdown or Jupyter notebooks;
* Looking to communicate their research more effectively.
There is no requirement to be familiar with the command line. The [workshop advert](workshop_advert.md) has more details about why people should attend the workshop.
The workshop is designed for 20-25 participants with 4-5 helpers and instructors.

## Venue requirements
This workshop works best in a room with small tables so that participants can support each other during the practical session. The other key requirements are a projector, reliable wifi and plenty of plug points.

## Before the workshop
Information should be sent out to participants one week before the workshop with instructions to get a GitHub account, bring a small sample of code and data to 'binderise', and guidance on getting to the venue. There are [example emails](before_workshop.md) which were sent out to participants for the Turing Way-run workshops in Manchester and London in March 2019.
