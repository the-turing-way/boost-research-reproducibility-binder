# Boost Your Research Reproducibility with Binder

In this folder you can find the materials you need to run a Turing Way developed workshop to help researchers share their research in a reproducible way using Binder.

* An [instructor's guide](instructor_guide.md) to running the workshop
* Agendas for your workshop:
  * [Carpentry Connect: 26 June 2019](agenda#carpentry-connect-26-june-2019)
* [Paired examples](paired_examples.md) exercise
* A folder of [workshop presentations](workshop-presentations) (some in `md` format, others in `pptx` and `pdf` where available, only `pdfs` linked below)
  * [Introduction](workshop-presentations/PRE_IntroBoostResReproBinder.pdf) to Manchester workshop on 1 March 2019 by [Rosie Higman](https://github.com/rosiehigman).
  * [Introduction](workshop-presentations/PRE_IntroBoostResReproBinder_ATI.pdf) to London workshop on 12 March 2019 by [Patricia Herterich](https://github.com/pherterich).
  * [Reproducible computational environments](workshop-presentations/ReproducibleComputationalEnvironment.pdf) for Manchester and London workshops by [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane).
  * [Zero to Binder code-along](workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder.md) for Manchester and London workshops by [Sarah Gibson](https://github.com/sgibson91) building heavily off [Tim Head's](https://github.com/betatim) [Build a Binder](https://build-a-binder.github.io/) workshop materials.
* Links to notes form the Manchester and London workshops in March 2019:
  * [Manchester notes](https://bit.ly/TuringWayMCRNotes)
  * [London notes](https://bit.ly/TuringWayLDNnotes)
* [Communications](before_workshop.md) and [Workshop advert](workshop_advert.md) to send out before the workshop.
  * These are specific to the Manchester and London workshops in March 2019, but can easily be adapted.
* [Feedback form](feedback_form.md) that you can make into a google form
  * Such as [this one](https://goo.gl/forms/DZGFMPJ4EPClc4qK2) for the Manchester and London workshops in March 2019.
* Records of [feedback](feedback) from previous workshops.
* Feedback [report](feedback/report.md) on the workshops.
