# Boost Your Research Reproducibility with Binder

In this folder you can find the materials you need to take part in a Turing Way developed workshop to help researchers share their research in a reproducible way using Binder.

* A full day workshop [agenda](agenda.md)
  * (There is a half day version in development) 
* [Paired examples](paired_examples.md) exercise
* A folder of [workshop presentations](workshop-presentations) (`pptx` and `pdf`, only `pdfs` linked below)
  * [Introduction](workshop-presentations/PRE_IntroBoostResReproBinder.pdf) to Manchester workshop on 1 March 2019 by [Rosie Higman](https://github.com/rosiehigman).
  * [Introduction](workshop-presentations/PRE_IntroBoostResReproBinder_ATI.pdf) to London workshop on 12 March 2019 by [Patricia Herterich](https://github.com/pherterich).
  * [Reproducible computational environments](workshop-presentations/ReproducibleComputationalEnvironment.pdf) for Manchester and London workshops by [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane).
  * [Zero to Binder code-along](workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder.md) for Manchester and London workshops by [Sarah Gibson](https://github.com/sgibson91) building heavily off [Tim Head's](https://github.com/betatim) [Build a Binder](https://build-a-binder.github.io/) workshop materials.
* [Communications](before_workshop.md) to send out before the workshop
  * These are specific to the Manchester and London workshops in March 2019, but can easily be adapted.
* [Feedback form](feedback_form.md) that you can make into a google form
  * Wuch as [this one](https://goo.gl/forms/DZGFMPJ4EPClc4qK2) for the Manchester and London workshops in March 2019.
