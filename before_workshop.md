Hi!

We are looking forward to welcoming you to the 'Boost your research reproducibility with Binder' workshop in Manchester next week.

There is now an updated agenda: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/agenda.md available and please note that we will begin registration at 9.30am and will formally close at 4pm so that those with caring responsibilities can get home!

We have funds available for travel and childcare support if you need them. Please get in touch with theturingway@gmail.com to discuss how we can support you.

Please bring some code and some data. The code should take less than 10 minutes to run, and the data should be less than 20 MB. This might mean that you just pick one script from a bigger project, or bring a subset of your data. Note that it's really important that the code and data can be made public because we'll be using the public binder instance.

We have helpers at the event who are confident building binders for Python and R projects. They can be either scripts (`.py`, `.R`) or notebooks (`.ipynb` or `.Rmd`). If you are planning to bring code that is not written in R or Python, please send theturingway@gmail.com a little message to make sure that we're prepared for your project ðŸ˜¸

Please sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join.

We are dedicated to an inclusive and supportive event. Please read the code of conduct before you come along: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

If you have any questions ahead of the event please drop us an email at theturingway@gmail.com
