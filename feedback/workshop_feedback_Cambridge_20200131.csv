I thought the pace was right and the examples were useful.",There wasn't much that was missing  or that could be improved,"Yes, I think BAS will certainly make use of Binder in future.",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"It should focus on the specific details necessary to apply guides such as the Turing Way within BAS. It shouldn't try and diverge too much from these guides, but just be the very BAS specific parts."

","I think I will absolutely use binder in future. Using the 'docker' aspects to ensure I am replicating my environment is something I have never done before, but see will be hugely useful both now when working on different machines, but also looking further ahead will be great if I move institutions, or spend time working at other places.
Also, when publishing work, saving the entire set up, so the work is truly reproducible, and saved in a way I know will work again in future if I wanted to revisit it is really appealing!",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"I think this should focus on 'what to do' rather than 'how to do it', i.e. that it is necessary to save the code, the environment and the datasets etc in a way which they can be re-used again in future, rather than enforcing particular programmes and methods.
A proposed method, which is properly supported and for which training is offered etc is always great, but it should be possible for people to use other methods if they prefer - the emphasis should be on what is needed, rather then rules on how to achieve that aim."

My usual data and code are too large for Binder and I opt for directly using containers instead.  It may be useful for small examples of my research, to demonstrate the method without requiring access to an HPC system.",Strongly Agree,Agree,"It should cover best practices to make each type of research reproducible - one area that is lacking is how to have reproducible computer simulations, particularly when the simulations are too large to make use of free, online data storage, but not large enough to have a dedicated server and team, such as the global climate simulations. It would be helpful to have a point of contact for each within BAS.  Finally, until making research reproducible takes no additional time or effort, BAS management should recognize reproducibility and reward for it. We can't rely on individual scientists putting in additional time and effort, without direct compensation, simply because they believe in the benefits and ethics of reproducibility, when they are only rewarded for writing papers and winning grants."
